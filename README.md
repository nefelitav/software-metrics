# Software Metrics
In this program we use Rascal to calculate the following source code metrics on software projects:
- Volume
- Duplication
- Unit Size
- Unit Complexity
- Unit Interfacing
- Unit Testing

And with these, the following system level metrics:
- Analysability
- Testability
- Changeability
- Stability
- Maintainability
